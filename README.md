A Simpsons themed slot machine program for Raspberry Pi. Written in Python.3 using the Pygame module. <br>

<h2> About </h2>
This program was made in order to learn the Python modul "Pygame". It was made on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B on the Raspian Jessie OS. The entire program is hardcoded to run on a 1680x1050px screen and haven't been tested on other resolutions - if the graphics doesn't look right, it's probably the resolution of the display that is wrong.

<li>
  Python 3 IDE<br>
