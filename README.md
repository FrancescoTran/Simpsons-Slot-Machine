<h2> About </h2>
A Simpsons themed slot machine program for Raspberry Pi. Written in Python.3 using the Pygame module. <br> This program was made in order to learn the Python modul "Pygame". It was made on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B on the Raspian Jessie OS. The entire program is hardcoded to run at a 1680x1050px resolution and haven't been tested on other resolution displays - if the graphics doesn't look right, it's probably the resolution of the display that is wrong. 
<br><br>
<h2>How to run</h2>
In order to run the program, you'll need:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3 IDE</li>
  <li>PyGame Module</li>
  <li>Windows, Mac, or a Linux distribution</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>How to play:</h2>
Use the number keys 1,2, and 3 to bet 10, 50, and 100 credits respectively.<br>
Use the nu,ber keys 4, 5, and 6 to play on playlines 1,2, and 3 respectively.

<br>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
This is far from a finished program so bugs and missing features are a guarantee! I've compiled a list of known bugs that I'm working on getting squashed:
<ul>
  <li>If you win on more playlines at once you will sometimes only get payed for one of them.</li>
  <li>Spamming the keys while the wheels are running will queue the keypresses instead of ignoring them.</li>
  <li>When winning, the playlines flashing green sometimes bugs out and blinks in a weird way.</li>
</ul>
